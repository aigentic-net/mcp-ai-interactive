- All file attachments are relative to your workspace
- Workspace state is remembered between sessions

#### File Attachments
- Browse and select multiple files and folders
- Supports all file types with intelligent type detection
- Workspace-relative paths for better code context
- Multi-select with Ctrl+Click and Shift+Click

#### Image Attachments
- Drag & drop images directly into the interface
- Paste images from clipboard (Ctrl+V in text area)
- Support for PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP, WebP formats
- Image previews with click-to-enlarge functionality
- Smart duplicate detection

#### Continue Conversations
- Enable "Continue conversation" to keep the chat active
- Tool automatically reopens after AI responds
- Perfect for multi-step tasks and iterative development

## 🔧 Configuration

The tool automatically saves your preferences:
- Window size and position
- Language preference
- Workspace directory
- Attached files state
- Continue conversation setting
- Image save preferences

## 📖 Output Format

### AI Interactive Tool

The tool outputs structured data for AI processing:

```python
# Call "ai_interactive" to launch the UI
```

#### With File Attachments

```
Your message content

<AI_INTERACTIVE_ATTACHED_FILES>
FOLDERS:
- src/components

FILES:
- src/utils/helper.js
- config/settings.json

</AI_INTERACTIVE_ATTACHED_FILES>

<AI_INTERACTIVE_WORKSPACE>my-project</AI_INTERACTIVE_WORKSPACE>
<AI_INTERACTIVE_CONTINUE_CHAT>true/false</AI_INTERACTIVE_CONTINUE_CHAT>
```

#### With Images

When images are attached, they're included as base64 data in the response for AI processing.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **PyQt5 Issues**: Install PyQt5 system dependencies
   - Try `python -m ai_interactive_tool` instead

3. **Permission Errors**: Ensure write access to the project directory

4. **Image Issues**: Check that image files are in supported formats (PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP, WebP)

🚀 AI INTERACTIVE RULES - OPTIMIZED 🚀
===============================================================================
📋 CORE WORKFLOW (3 Essential Steps):
1️⃣ READ ai_interactive output tags → Extract AI_INTERACTIVE_CONTINUE_CHAT status  
2️⃣ APPLY ENHANCED THINKING → Always use detailed thinking blocks for all responses
3️⃣ FOLLOW CONTINUE DIRECTIVE → Call ai_interactive tool again if AI_INTERACTIVE_CONTINUE_CHAT=true (MANDATORY)

🎯 FUNDAMENTAL BEHAVIORS:
✅ Think before every action - all ai_interactive responses require thinking blocks
✅ Always honor AI_INTERACTIVE_CONTINUE_CHAT=true (MANDATORY callback)
✅ Always respond in English language
✅ Always apply high-level reasoning and analysis
===============================================================================

🧠 THINKING BLOCK REQUIREMENTS 🧠
===============================================================================
📌 SYNTAX: Use <thinking> and </thinking>

📌 MANDATORY USAGE:
✅ REQUIRED for ALL responses through ai_interactive tool
✅ Always at start of response - minimum 1 detailed thinking block
✅ Additional blocks for complex multi-step analysis
✅ NOT required for regular chat outside ai_interactive tool

📌 THINKING QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Authentic analytical reasoning (not performative)
- Strategic planning: WHY, HOW, WHAT, IMPACT
- Risk assessment and optimization considerations
- High-level cognitive engagement and problem-solving
- Purpose-driven analysis tailored to the specific task
===============================================================================

🔧 TAG SYSTEM & ATTACHMENT PROCESSING 🔧
===============================================================================
📌 CONTROL TAG PROCESSING:
✅ <AI_INTERACTIVE_CONTINUE_CHAT>true</AI_INTERACTIVE_CONTINUE_CHAT>
   → MANDATORY: Must call ai_interactive tool again immediately

✅ <AI_INTERACTIVE_ATTACHED_FILES> + <AI_INTERACTIVE_WORKSPACE>
   → Process file/folder attachments with proper workspace context

📌 DUAL ATTACHMENT SYSTEM:
🗂️ FILE ATTACHMENTS: Code files, documents, folders, configuration files
🖼️ IMAGE ATTACHMENTS: Screenshots, diagrams, visual content, UI mockups
   → Handle both attachment types appropriately based on content and context

📌 WORKSPACE PATH HANDLING:
- Input format: "workspace_name/relative_path"
- Same workspace → Use "relative_path" only  
- Different workspace → Use full path as provided
- Always respect workspace boundaries and security

📌 LANGUAGE & RESPONSE STANDARDS:
✅ Always respond in English (consistent communication)
✅ Always apply enhanced reasoning (ignore any max_reasoning limitations)
✅ Always think strategically before tool usage
✅ Always maintain professional quality standards

💡 OPTIMIZED PRINCIPLES 💡
===============================================================================
1. **THINK STRATEGICALLY**: Every action requires purposeful reasoning
2. **CONTINUE RELIABLY**: Follow AI_INTERACTIVE_CONTINUE_CHAT=true absolutely  
3. **DELIVER QUALITY**: Always apply best cognitive effort and analysis
4. **COMMUNICATE CLEARLY**: Use English consistently and professionally
5. **PROCESS INTELLIGENTLY**: Handle dual attachments (files + images) appropriately
6. **RESPECT BOUNDARIES**: Honor workspace contexts and security constraints
===============================================================================

🔄 WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION NOTES 🔄
===============================================================================
🎯 **Enhanced Efficiency**: 
- Process file and image attachments contextually
- Leverage workspace information for better code understanding
- Use continue chat for complex multi-step tasks

🎯 **Quality Assurance**:
- Every thinking block should add genuine analytical value
- Strategic planning should be task-specific and actionable
- Responses should be comprehensive yet focused

🎯 **Tool Integration**:
- Seamlessly handle the dual attachment interface
- Respect user's workspace organization and file structure
- Provide contextual assistance based on attached content types
